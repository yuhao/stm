EE382N course project on STM

The University of Texas at Austin, Software Transactional Memory Group.

We have following ideas:
+ characterize different STM algorithms, see if there's any hot code/func to accelerate
+ per-thread STM algorithm prediction
 - change policy
 - pair-wise mutual exclusion
+ global STM algorithm prediction
